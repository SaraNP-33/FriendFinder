# FriendFinder

In this app, there is a basic intereaction between front-end and back-end. The user starts by filling out a survey of 10 questions. Once the user hits the submit button, their answer are sent to our server who calculates the total difference between the answer of the user and the friends already existing in the app. Once the calculation is done, the app will pop-up the best match for the user.

When the user first enters the app, they will the homepage. At this point the user can choose to 
click on the API Friends List, which will take him to the list of friends that is showcased as a JSON object. We did not use a database on this exercise, therefore this list lives in a .js file in my machine/Github Repo:
